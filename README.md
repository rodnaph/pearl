Pearl - Easy Portfile Updates
=============================

Pearl is a super-simple script to make it a little bit easier to update your [Macports](https://macports.org) Portfile for your project.  It just automates the diffing of your current Portfile with the release version from the [Macports SVN](https://svn.macports.org) repository.

Installation
------------

You can install Pearl through Macportsâ€¦

```bash
sudo port install pearl
```

If you're installing from source just clone the repository and put it in your $PATH.

Usage
-----

Just change to your project folder and run Pearl.

```bash
pearl
```

By default this assumes you have your Portfile in your repository root, and it will create a diff'd version named _Portfile-yourproject.diff_ (where the name of the project is guessed from the current directory).

You can then submit this file via the [Macports Trac](https://trac.macports.org) for an update.

Configuration
-------------

This is handled by a small [YAML](http://yaml.org/) file in your project root named _.pearl.yml_.  Here are the options...

```yaml
# required
project_type:       devel

# optional
portfile:           path/to/Portfile
project_name:       my-project
```
